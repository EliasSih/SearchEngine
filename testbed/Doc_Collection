unique perspective and style to the movement, contributing to its diverse 
and vibrant history.

Impressionism was a groundbreaking movement in the history of art, 
challenging traditional notions of realism and paving the way for modern art
 movements to come. By capturing the fleeting beauty of everyday life 
through the use of color, light, and texture, Impressionist paintings 
continue to inspire and captivate viewers today.

Ancient Egyptian art spans over three thousand years, from the Early 
Dynastic period to the Greco-Roman period. It was created for a variety of
 purposes, including religious, funerary, and political contexts.

One of the most prominent features of ancient Egyptian art is its emphasis 
on symbolism and hieroglyphics. Egyptian art was often used to convey 
important religious and political messages, and hieroglyphics were used to 
represent both words and ideas. Additionally, Egyptian art often featured 
depictions of gods, pharaohs, and other important figures, showcasing the
 power and influence of these individuals.

Some of the most famous works of Egyptian art include the Great Sphinx of 
Giza, a monumental sculpture of a mythical creature with the head of a human

The Renaissance
.W
The Renaissance is the time period following the Middle Ages, spanning from
 the 15th to the 17th century. The word renaissance is of French origin and 
is defined as “rebirth”. This is name is fitting for this period as it is
 one of the most pivotal points in human history. During the Renaissance,
 humanity resurrected the quintessence of the Classical period in all eras 
of life. Science, politics, economics, and above all else, the arts. Some of
 the most revered paintings and sculptures in existence were created during
 the Renaissance.

Many complex factors sparked the start of the Renaissance period, such as
 increased cultural exchange due to trade routes and holy wars, innovations
 like the Gutenberg printing press, and the Black Death, which shook 
people’s unquestioning religious beliefs. However, one of the most important
 factors can be attributed to the rediscovery of ancient texts. Historians 
ascribe this revival to the Italian scholar Francesco Petrarca.

Petrarch discovered letters of the Roman scholar, Cicero, in which he found
 ancient philosophies founded on logic and reason. This prompted other 
scholars around Italy, and Europe as a whole, to seek out more ancien
 texts. Petrarch also came to be known as the Father of Humanism, a 
philosophy that places importance on man, rather than divine power, 
controlling his fat

Renaissance art is often divided into three phases: Early Renaissance, High 
Renaissance, and Late Renaissance. Although vastly similar, there are some 
distinguishing factors between these three phases. During the Early 
Renaissance Florence, which was at this time an independent city-state, was
 the epicenter of art in Italy. This was largely due to the increased art
 patronage of the Catholic Church and the Medici family in the area. Large
 amounts of money were spent, particularly on sculptures, to decorate the 
city. Greek and Roman mythology were favorite themes of Early Renaissance 
sculptors.

Investing 101: A Beginner's Guide
.W
Steps to Get Started
1. Define Your Tolerance for Risk
What's your tolerance for risk (the chance that you may lose money while
 investing)? Stocks are categorized in various ways, such as large
 capitalization stocks, small cap stocks, aggressive growth stocks, and 
value stocks. They all have different levels of risk. Once you determine 
your risk tolerance, you can set your investment sights on the stocks that
 complement it.

2. Decide on Your Investment Goals
You should also determine your investment goals. When opening a brokerage 
account, an online broker such as Charles Schwab or Fidelity will ask you 
about your investment goals (and the aforementioned level of risk that 
you’re willing to take).

If you're just beginning your career, an investment goal could be to 
increase the amount of money in your account. If you're older, you may want
 to generate income as well as grow and protect your wealth.
Your investment goals might include buying a house, funding your retirement,
 or saving for tuition. Goals can change over time. Just make sure that you 
define and review them periodically so that you can keep your focus on 
achieving them.
3. Determine Your Investing Style
Some investors want to take an active hand in managing their investments,
 while others prefer to set it and forget it. Your preference may change, 
but decide on an approach to get started.

If you're confident about your investing knowledge and capability, you could
 manage your investing and portfolio on your own. Traditional online 
brokers, like the two mentioned above, allow you to invest in stocks, bonds,
 exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and mutual funds. 
An experienced broker or financial advisor can help you make your investment
 decisions, monitor your portfolio, and make changes to it. This is a good 
option for beginners who understand the importance of investing but may want
 an expert to help them do it.
A robo-advisor is an automated, hands-off option that typically costs less
 than working with a broker or financial advisor. Once a robo-advisor 
program has your goals, risk tolerance level, and other details, it 
automatically invests for you.

4. Choose Your Investment Account
Retirement plan at work: You can invest in various stock and bond mutual 
funds and target-date funds through a retirement plan at work, such as a 
401(k), if your employer offers one. It may also offer the option of 
investing in the employer's company stock.

The Evolution of Formula One Cars
.W
ormula One (F1) is a motorsport that has captured the imagination of 
millions of people around the world since its inception in 1950. As a 
pinnacle of automotive engineering and technology, the Evolution of F1 Cars 
design has undergone significant changes over the decades. With advancements in materials, engineering techniques, and a better understanding of aerodynamics. F1 cars have become faster, lighter, and more efficient than ever before.

In this article, we will explore the evolution of F1 car design over the 
years. From the early days of the sport, when cars had no wings and relied 
on mechanical grip. To the modern-day machines with advanced aerodynamics 
and hybrid power units. We will delve into the key milestones and 
developments that have shaped the design of F1 cars over the years.

Early F1 Car Design (1950s-1960s)
Evolution of F1 Cars race took place at Silverstone, England, in 1950. At
 that time, F1 cars were relatively simple in design and technology. A 
front-mounted engine, skinny tires, and no aerodynamics to speak of. In the
 1950s, F1 car design began to evolve, with engineers experimenting with 
different designs and technologies to improve performance.

One of the key advancements during this period was the move from front-
mounted engines to rear-mounted engines. The first rear-engined F1 car was
 the Cooper T51, which was designed by British engineer John Cooper in 1959.
 The Cooper T51 proved to be a game-changer. As its rear-mounted engine 
allowed for better weight distribution and improved handling. Making it 
faster and more efficient than its front-engined counterparts.

The 1960s saw further advancements in F1 car design, with engineers 
experimenting with new materials and technologies to improve performance. In
 1961, Lotus introduced the first-ever monocoque chassis, which was made of
 lightweight aluminum and provided better safety and handling than the 
tubular steel chassis that had been used up to that point. In 1968, Lotus 
introduced the famous “wedge” design, which featured a low nose and high 
tail, improving aerodynamics and downforce.

Evolution of F1 Cars: The Turbo Era (1970s-1980s)
In the 1970s, F1 car design took another leap forward with the introduction 
of turbocharged engines. Turbocharged engines were smaller and lighter than 
their naturally aspirated counterparts. They could produce more power,
 allowing F1 cars to reach higher speeds than ever before. This period also 
saw the introduction of ground-effect aerodynamics, which used underbody air pressure to increase downforce and improve grip.

Famous Formula One Drivers
.W

1. Lewis Hamilton - 103 wins
First race: 2007 Australian Grand Prix
World Championships: 7 (2008, 2014-15, 2017-20) 
Number of races: 310 
Number of wins: 103 
Number of pole positions: 103 
Career points: 4415.5 
In terms of career wins and total career points, Lewis Hamilton is the best 
Formula 1 driver to have ever graced a circuit. The Brit has taken wins in 
30 different countries, won a race in almost every season he’s competed in,
 and is currently tied on world championships with Michael Schumacher, 
having narrowly missed out on taking an eighth world title in 2021 to Max 
Verstappen. Hamilton holds many of Formula 1’s records and, with a contract
 that runs to the end of 2023, he looks to be able to push even further 
ahead on many of them. 

While he missed becoming champion in his first season by a single point, he
 became the (then) youngest world champion the following year. Fourteen 
years later he’s secured six more titles, and is hunting for an eighth. 

2. Michael Schumacher - 91 wins
First race: 1991 Belgian Grand Prix
World Championships: 7 (1994-95, 2000-04)
Number of races: 308
Number of wins: 91
Number of pole positions: 68
Career points: 1566
When considering the best F1 driver, Michael Schumacher immediately springs 
to mind. He was, until the rise of Hamilton, the face of domination in 
Formula 1: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly 
insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting competitiveness – Schumacher 
changed the game in F1 with his combination of dedication, passion, and, of course, raw talent.

3. Sebastian Vettel - 53 wins
First race: 2007 United States Grand Prix
World Championships: 4 (2010-13)
Number of races: 300
Number of wins: 53
Number of pole positions: 57
Career points: 3098
While his form in Formula 1 slowed towards the end of his career, there was
 a time when Sebastian Vettel was virtually unbeatable.

Vettel’s F1 career started in 2007 and, in his first three years, he took 
nine podiums and five wins, though this was nothing on what was to come. 
Over the next four years he became the face of F1, winning four consecutive 
championships and becoming the youngest world champion in the process 
(taking the accolade from Lewis Hamilton). He also secured the records for
 most podium finishes in a season, most wins in a season, most pole 
positions in a season, most laps led in a season, most consecutive wins, 
most consecutive grand slams, and most wins from pole position in a season.

Unfortunately for Vettel the regulation changes in 2014 didn’t suit Red Bull
 (or him), and the team quickly fell back through the pack. He went from 
nine consecutive wins in the final nine races of the 2013 season to not 
winning a single race until 2015, and since that 2013 season he’s ‘only’ 
taken 14 wins. Despite that he was still widely regarded as one of the best
 drivers on the grid until his retirement at the end of the 2022 season, and his list of records is likely to stand for many more seasons.

The Business of Formula One Racing
.W
How does F1 make money?

F1's biggest revenue stream comes from the sale of television rights, which 
in the United States alone was worth $4 million a season in 2017. Globally,
 television contracts added a staggering $587 million to Liberty Media's 
balance sheet. Unlike most sports or racing series, Formula 1 handles all TV
 logistics at all of the venues and provides what's called a "global feed" to
 hundreds of TV networks—each of whom pay a colossal price of admission. 

F1's second-biggest revenue stream is made up of what is called "race-
sanctioning fees." Every F1 venue in the world—from a classic like Monaco to
 a newbie like Baku—has to pay a massive fee to F1 to be added to the 
calendar. SEC filings show that F1 made $654 million in sanctioning fees for
 the 2016 season, which featured 21 races. This means that the average fee
 F1 charges are roughly $31 million.

F1's third-biggest revenue stream is a combination of ticket sales and other
 paid partnerships with companies or products. On top of the already hefty
 sanction fee, venues must pay a percentage of the ticket sales to the racing
 organization, although this is typically accounted for in the initial contract.

Driver salaries:

All drivers earn a salary from the team, even those who pay to drive, and
 they're also allowed to pursue personal endorsements with other companies,
 although a percentage of these earnings must be shared with the team. F1
 drivers do not receive purse money from racing venues or from Formula 1 
itself.

The Alonsos, Vettels, and Hamiltons of the world also enjoy hefty bonuses 
from their teams for scoring race wins, pole positions, fastest laps, and
 winning world championships. And although these bonuses and salaries are 
kept under wraps, it's rumored that Lewis Hamilton's salary is over $41 
million per year, and sources with ties to Sebastian Vettel claim that the 
German's bonus for delivering the fastest lap of the race was approximately
 $25,000 during his time at Red Bull and $500,000 for winning a Grand Prix.

Managing Debt and Credit
.W
Everyone with even a little bit of debt has to manage their debt. If you
just have a little debt, you have to keep up your payments and make sure it
 doesn’t get out of control. On the other hand, when you have a large amount
 of debt, you have to put more effort into paying off your debt while
juggling payments on the debts you’re not currently paying.

Know How Much You Owe
Make a list of your debts, including the creditor, total amount of the debt,
 monthly payment, interest rate, and due date. You can use your credit
report to confirm the debts on your list. Having all the debts in front of
you will allow you to see the bigger picture and stay aware of your complete
 debt picture. Debt reduction software can make this process easier.

Note
Once you have a handle on your debt and your income, you can calculate your
 Debt to Income ratio (DTI). This ratio tells you how much of your income is
 going toward debt payments. To find yours, divide your debt payments by
your income, and multiply by 100. For example, $1,200 of monthly debt
divided by $3,000 of monthly income is 0.4 x 100 = 40%. The lower this
number is, the better, and tracking it can help you understand your finances
 more clearly.

Don't just create your list and forget about it. Refer to your debt list
periodically, especially as you pay bills. Update your list every few months
 as the total amount of your debt changes.

Pay Your Bills on Time Each Month
Late payments make it harder to pay off your debt since you’ll have to pay a
 late fee for every payment you miss. If you miss two payments in a row,
your interest rate and finance charges will increase.

If you use a calendaring system on your computer or smartphone, enter your
 payments there and set an alert to remind you several days before your
 payment is due. If you miss a payment, don’t wait until the next due date
 to send your payment, by then it could be reported to a credit bureau.
Instead, send your payment as soon as you remember that it was missed.
